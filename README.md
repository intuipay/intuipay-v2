## 🎯 Product Vision

**To become the global standard for education payments by leveraging crypto's speed and cost efficiency, while abstracting its complexity for mainstream users.**

## 🚀 Overview

Intuipay transforms education financing through blockchain technology, offering a "crypto-invisible" alternative to traditional payment systems like SWIFT, Flywire, and Western Union. While global remittance has undergone a revolution, education financing has remained stagnant in the analog era—until now.

### The Problem
- **High Fees**: Traditional education payments carry hefty fees (5.2-8.8% on average)
- **Slow Processing**: 3-7 business days for settlement
- **Limited Access**: Restricted business hours and geographic limitations
- **Complex Processes**: Multiple intermediaries and complicated workflows

### Our Solution
**Crypto-invisible infrastructure** with stablecoins under the hood, enabling:
- ⚡ **Instant settlement** (24/7 availability)
- 💸 **Significantly lower fees** (~2-3% total, no hidden fees)
- 🌍 **Global accessibility** across multiple corridors
- 🔒 **Familiar experience** for non-crypto users (pay in fiat, receive in fiat)
