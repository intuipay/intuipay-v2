## 1. Scope of Pledge Services

Intuipay is a software and technology provider that provides a platform allowing creators ("**Creators**") to list projects ("**Projects**", and each listing a "**Project Listing**") to be supported by potential backers ("**Backers**"). Backers can support Projects by pledging to contribute digital assets, in exchange for one or more non-financial rewards ("**Rewards**") offered by a Creator.

The Pledge Services include our website at [intuipay.xyz](https://intuipay.xyz) (the "Website"), all related online and social media channels, and all related tools, applications, data, software and other products and services provided by us from time to time in relation to the Pledge Services, whether as a guest or a registered user.

## 2. Eligibility and Acceptance

The Pledge Services are offered and available to users who are 18 years of age or older and located in jurisdictions where the use and access of the Pledge Services do not violate any applicable laws. By using the Pledge Services, you represent and warrant that you are of legal age to form a binding contract with Intuipay and meet all of the eligibility requirements as determined by Intuipay, and whether specified in these Terms or otherwise. In particular, Restricted Persons are prohibited from accessing and/or using the Pledge Services. If you do not meet all of the foregoing requirements, you must not access or use the Pledge Services.

You shall provide Intuipay with written notice and immediately cease use of the Pledge Services if you no longer comply with any of the eligibility requirements. Failure to provide us with such written notice and to cease such use of the Pledge Services shall be considered a material breach of the Terms.

---

## 3. Accessing the Pledge Services and Security

To access the Pledge Services or some of the resources we offer, including as a Creator, Backer or Sub-User, you may be asked:

- to create an account with us (the "**Account**");
- to connect a third-party digital asset wallet ("**Wallet**") which allows you to engage in transactions on blockchains; and
- to provide certain information for registration and/or verification purposes (and to update such information from time to time).

You are responsible for making all arrangements necessary for you to have access to the Pledge Services.

It is a condition of your use of the Pledge Services that all information you provide on the Pledge Services is correct, current, and complete. You agree that all information you provide to register with this Pledge Services or otherwise, including, but not limited to, through the use of any interactive features on the Pledge Services, is governed by our Privacy Policy, and you consent to all actions we take with respect to your information consistent with our Privacy Policy.

If you choose, or are provided with, a username, password, or any other piece of information as part of our security procedures, you must treat such information as confidential, and you must not disclose it to any other person or entity. You also acknowledge that your Account is personal to you and agree not to provide any other person with access to this Pledge Services or portions of it using your username, password, or other security information.

## 4. Relationship of Intuipay, Creators and Backers

Intuipay provides a platform for Creators to connect with potential Backers in relation to the Projects. Where a Backer agrees to pledge contributions to a Creator in relation to a Project, a contract is formed solely between the Creator and the Backer. **Intuipay is not a party to this contract â€“ the contract is a direct agreement between Creators and their Backers.**

Under such contract, each of the Creator and the Backer, and not Intuipay, is responsible for their respective obligations in relation to the contract. These include but are not limited to:

- with respect to the Creator, the obligation to provide such Reward and/or fulfil such promises as stated in the Project Listing (as defined in Section 8 of these Terms); and
- with respect to the Backer, the obligation to transfer the pledged digital assets to the Creator through the Pledge Services upon successful completion of the Project Goal (as defined in Section 8 of these Terms).

Each contract shall be subject to such terms and conditions as specified by a Creator, as well as the following additional terms, which shall be incorporated into each contract formed through the Pledge Services. To the extent that the additional terms below conflict with any terms and conditions specified by a Creator, the following additional terms prevail:

- For the duration of a Project campaign and following the successful receipt of Project contributions, each Creator agrees to use best endeavours to fulfil any promises and obligations as stated in the Project Listing, and to deliver the Reward to a Backer. Each Creator agrees to communicate to their Backers in an honest and timely manner in relation to the development of the Project and other relevant matters.
- Each Backer agrees and acknowledges that the Creator is solely responsible for fulfilling their Project and delivering any Rewards. Each Backer further agrees and acknowledges that, depending on the nature of the Project and Reward, receipt of the Reward may not be guaranteed. Where any necessary information is required for the Creator to deliver the Reward (for example, shipping address), it is the responsibility of the Backer to provide such information in a timely and correct manner.
- Where a Creator is not able to deliver the Reward and/or fulfil any other agreed obligations, it must make a reasonable effort to find another way of bringing the Project to the best possible conclusion for Backers. A Creator in this position has remedied the situation and met their agrees to explain how the contributions will be used to complete the Project in another way or, where it is unable to do so, return any remaining contributions to the Backers (in proportion to the amounts pledged/contributed).

Intuipay does not represent any Creators featured on or through the Pledge Services, and does not guarantee that any pledges and/or contributions will be used for a specific purpose or that any Reward will be provided by a Creator. Intuipay cannot and will not intervene in any dispute between a Creator and a Backer for any pledges and/or contributions made using the Pledge Services. Intuipay is not liable to any Creator or Backer for any claim related to a pledge and/or contribution made via the Pledge Services.

**Where you are a Backer, you understand, acknowledge and agree that by choosing to pledge and/or make contributions through the Pledge Services, you do so at your own risk. Except in the event that a Creator is not able to deliver the Rewards, any contributed digital assets are non-refundable unless required by law or explicitly stated by the Creator. Intuipay does not guarantee that any contributions will be used by a Creator for a specific purpose. Intuipay is neither responsible nor obliged to address or resolve any issues or dissatisfaction you may have in relation to any digital assets you have pledged and/or contributed. You are encouraged to reach out to the respective Creators for further verification on the pledges and/or contributions made through the Pledge Services and other relevant inquiries.**

## 7. Pledge Transactions and Fees

Where you are a Backer, Intuipay will initiate a transaction to debit the pledged digital assets from your Wallet only if, at the time of the Project's funding deadline, the Project has reached its fundraising goal.

- Can Backers change the amount pledged? If so how/when?
- What if at the time that the transaction is initiated, the Backer does not have sufficient funds in their Wallet?
- Can Intuipay cancel a Backer's pledged amount?
- Can Backers pledge amounts after the end of a Project's fundraising deadline?

By using the Pledge Services, you agree to pay all relevant fees (including gas fees) in connection with: (a) where you are a Backer, pledging or contributing digital assets to a Project; and (b) where you are a Creator, the listing of the Project and withdrawal of all received digital assets, including any services fees imposed by Intuipay.

Where you are a Backer, Intuipay provides the Pledge Services to you free of charge. Where you are a Creator, Intuipay collects a service fee from you upon successful completion of the Project, where the quantum of such service fee shall be separately communicated to you. The service fee will be deducted from the total contributions received by you upon successful completion of the Project.
