Such third-party service providers, agents and/or affiliates or related corporations and/or other third parties would be processing your personal data either on our behalf or otherwise, for one or more of the above-stated Purposes. Such third parties include, without limitation:

For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that applicable privacy laws or other laws permit an organisation such as us to collect, use or disclose your personal data without your consent, such permission granted by the laws shall continue to apply. Consistent with the foregoing and subject to applicable law, we may use your personal data for recognized legal grounds including to comply with our legal obligations, to perform our contract with you, to achieve a legitimate interest and our reasons for using it outweigh any prejudice to your data protection rights, or where necessary in connection with a legal claim.

Third parties may unlawfully intercept or access personal data transmitted to or contained on the site, technologies may malfunction or not work as anticipated, or someone might access, abuse or misuse information through no fault of ours. We will nevertheless deploy reasonable security arrangements to protect your personal data as required by the applicable privacy laws; however there can inevitably be no guarantee of absolute security such as but not limited to when unauthorised disclosure arises from malicious and sophisticated hacking by malcontents through no fault of ours.

Users in possession of another user's personal data through the use of the Services (the "Receiving Party") hereby agree that they will (i) comply with all applicable personal data protection laws with respect to any such data; (ii) allow the user whose personal data the Receiving Party has collected (the "Disclosing Party") to remove his or her data so collected from the Receiving Party's database; and (iii) allow the Disclosing Party to review what information has been collected about them by the Receiving Party, in each case of (ii) and (iii) above, in compliance with and where required by applicable laws.

Notwithstanding anything set forth herein, fundraisers and Campaigns hosted on the Website and/or through the Services shall comply with all applicable privacy laws and, in respect of any Donor's personal data received from Intuipay, (i) are not permitted to use such Donor's personal data except as reasonably necessary to respond to Donors' enquiries and to carry out respond to, process, deal with or complete a transaction without the Donors' and Intuipay's prior written consent; (ii) should refrain from contacting Donors using such information outside of the Website and/or our Services; (iii) are not permitted to disclose such Donor's personal data to any unauthorized third parties without the Donor's and Intuipay's prior written consent; (iv) shall employ sufficient security measures to protect each Intuipay user's personal data in their possession and to delete such data as soon as reasonably possible upon completion of the transaction; and (v) to inform Intuipay's Personal Data Protection Officer at [insert link] in the event of any potential data breach or other loss of such user's data.

**WE DO NOT GUARANTEE THE SECURITY OF PERSONAL DATA AND/OR OTHER INFORMATION THAT YOU PROVIDE ON THIRD PARTY SITES.** We do implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal data that is in our possession or under our control. Your personal data is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of persons who have special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the personal data confidential. When you place orders or access your personal data, we offer the use of a secure server. All personal data or sensitive information you supply is encrypted into our databases to be only accessed as stated above.

In an attempt to provide you with increased value, we may choose various third-party websites to link to, and frame within, the Website and Services, including but not limited to third-party websites of Partner Payment Processors. We may also participate in co-branding and other relationships to offer e-commerce and other services and features to our visitors. These linked sites have separate and independent privacy policies as well as security arrangements. Even if the third party is affiliated with us, we have no control over these linked sites, each of which has separate privacy and data collection practices independent of us. Data collected by our co-brand partners or third-party websites (even if offered on or through our Website or Services) may not be received by us.

We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content, security arrangements (or lack thereof) and activities of these linked sites. These linked sites are only for your convenience and you therefore access them at your own risk. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our Website and Services and the links placed upon each of them and therefore welcome any feedback about these linked sites (including, without limitation, if a specific link does not work).

## 12. How can you withdraw consent, request access to, correction or deletion of information you have provided to us?

You may do so by submitting a written request via email to our Personal Data Protection Officer at [insert link]. Your request may mean that we will not be able to continue providing the Services to you and we may need to terminate your existing relationship and/or the contract you have with us.

We may charge you a reasonable fee for the handling and processing of your requests. If we so choose to charge, we will provide you with a written estimate of the fee we will be charging. Please note that we are not required to respond to or deal with your request unless you have agreed to pay the fee.

We reserve the right to refuse to correct/delete your personal data in accordance with the provisions as set out in applicable privacy laws, where they require and/or entitle an organisation to refuse to correct/delete personal data in stated circumstances.
